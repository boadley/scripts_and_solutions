   ## Explanation for solutions directory
   Sometimes, a lot of times, I find myself playing coding games and doing small coding challenges. Someone somewhere might just need a little help sometime, this folder would be there to help them. Secondly, some of my solutions are small, perfect function that is useful for a more serious project.
    
   ## Explanation for scripts directory
   Sometimes, I actually write useful code (when I just can't find an already made solution, I love ready-made solutions 😍. I'll be storing those scripts here, maybe someone, somewhere, might find them useful sometimes 😊.
   
   ### Postscriptum
   __Information management is hard__
   If you've read this far, then you're probably very interested in this repo, the inner READMEs, are more comprehensive.
    
   __Do you think this is kewl?__
   Consider contributing your solutions and scripts, every contribution will be recognized (including none code contributions).
    
   ### FAQ
   Q. Why don't you create a separate repo for each script?
    
   A. If a script gets enough attention (usage, issues etc.). I would consider putting it in a separate repo and If it's really useful, we can make a library out of it!
